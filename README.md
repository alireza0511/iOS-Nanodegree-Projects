# iOS-Nanodegree-Projects
This repository content projects of my course of iOS Nanodegree with Udacity. Each project covers important aspect of iOS app development and is hosted as subdirectory.

Pitch Perfect

An iPhone app that allows users to record their voice and modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

- Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
- Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
- Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code and using UIViewController, and UIView
- Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
- Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
- Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
- Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
- Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code

MemeMe 1.0

This app enables the user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user is able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.

- Access the Camera and Photo Album using the UIImagePickerController
- Understand how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs, and protocols are used in iOS apps
- Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
- Use a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
- Describe the delegate pattern and give a full account of its importance and uses in iOS classes

MemeMe 2.0

In this app, sent memes to appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

- Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
- Build tables with datasources and delegates
- Create custom table view cells
- Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views

On the Map

On the Map is an app with a map that shows information posted by other Udacity's students. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

- Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
- Authenticating a user using over a network connection
- Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
- Use Core Location and the MapKit framework to display annotated pins on a map

Virtual Tourist

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map as if they were stops on a tour. Users then are able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures and the association of the pictures with the pin.

- Use NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API
- Create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and downloads progress
- Store media on the device file system Use Core Data for local persistence of an object structure
